This project, "SmileSchool," is a key component of the ALX Frontend specialization, designed to hone advanced CSS implementation skills. The primary objective is to meticulously translate a provided Figma design into a fully functional, responsive, and pixel-perfect webpage. The focus extends beyond basic styling to encompass code quality, structural integrity, and an optimal user experience. By working with custom CSS, external fonts, and image assets, the task involves building the single index.html page to precisely mirror the original design's layout, typography, and visual details, demonstrating a strong grasp of modern front-end development principles.
