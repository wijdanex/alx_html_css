This project is a responsive landing page built using **only HTML and CSS** — no JavaScript, no external frameworks.  
It was created to practice semantic markup, accessibility, and responsive design fundamentals.

Project Overview

The goal is to reproduce the provided Figma design as accurately as possible.  
The webpage includes:
- A hero section with a background image and call-to-action button  
- A “What we do” section with four feature icons  
- A “Our results” section displaying statistics in pentagons  
- A contact form and footer

Requirements

- **No external CSS frameworks** (e.g. Bootstrap not allowed)  
- **No JavaScript**  
- **Responsive Design:** The layout must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is **480px or less**  
- **Max width:** The main content must not exceed **1000px**, and should be **centered** on the page  
- **Links hover/active color:** `#FF6565`  
- **Buttons hover/active:** `opacity: 0.9`  

Accessibility

- Semantic HTML tags (header, nav, main, section, footer)  
- Form labels associated with inputs  
- Visible focus states for keyboard navigation  
- Text alternatives for icons and images
